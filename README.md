# Introduction
**KoronaCore** is *Minecraft: Java edition* mod for KoronaŚwiat /kɔrɔna ʑviat/ (*from Polish: KoronaWorld*) server. Mod already appeared on *Bedrock edition* as addon, 
but less developed due to platform limitations. The server also have own story made by author and players.

The mod at first contained a lot of random ideas, which later began to form a larger whole. It does not only consist of things that help in server management 
(for example New currency - [*KoronaCoin*](https://wiktorwox.wixsite.com/koronaswiat/koronacoin) or *Heart of the base* (Some kind of cuboid)), but also adds many 
things that diversify the gameplay, such as new weapons, items, [archivements](https://wiktorwox.wixsite.com/koronaswiat/osiagniecia-2) or mechanics 
(for example [*Soul pickaxe*](https://wiktorwox.wixsite.com/koronaswiat/kilof-dusz) or [*Magic staff*](https://wiktorwox.wixsite.com/koronaswiat/magiczna-laska)).
